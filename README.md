# Machine Learning Based Crop Recommendation System for optimised Agricultural Yield
# Overview
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based web application that helps farmers and agricultural experts choose the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental conditions. It leverages data analytics and predictive modeling to improve crop yield, optimize resource usage, and support smart farming decisions.

The system takes into account several factors such as soil type, climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels to determine the most suitable crops for a given region. By analyzing historical data and using predictive models, the system provides personalized recommendations tailored to the specific conditions of a farm or agricultural area.

# ✅Features
🔹 Input Data Collection

Users can input crucial parameters like:
Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Soil pH, Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall


🔹 Data Preprocessing

1 - Handling of missing values

2 - Normalization/Scaling of input features

3 - Encoding of categorical variables (if any)

🔹 Machine Learning Models

This system uses multiple algorithms for better accuracy:

1 - Decision Tree

2 - Random Forest

3- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4 - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)

🔹 Model Training & Evaluation

  Trained on historical agricultural datasets

  Evaluated using metrics such as: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

🔹 Crop Recommendation

  Predicts and suggests the best crops based on given conditions.

🔹 User-Friendly Web Interface

  Built using Flask

  Simple input form & clear output results

# Future Enhancements
# 1. AI-Powered Chatbot Assistance

  Integrate a chatbot that interacts with farmers in local languages.
  
  Farmers can ask questions like “Which crop should I grow now?” or “Why is my soil pH affecting wheat growth?”.

# 2. Voice Input & Output System

  Enable voice-based interaction so even non-literate users can provide soil and weather details verbally.

  The system can speak back recommendations using text-to-speech.

# 3. Drone & Satellite Data Integration

  Integrate with drone imagery or satellite NDVI data to detect:

  Crop health status

  Water stress levels

  Pest or disease-affected regions
